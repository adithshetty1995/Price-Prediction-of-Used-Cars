# Price-Prediction-of-Used-Cars using Random Forest Classifier, K-Folds Cross Validation, and Python

- Built a prediction model applying the Random Forest Regression Algorithm employing data preprocessing, feature normalization, label encoding, and data modeling with Scikit-learn pre-processing to estimate the price of a car
- Evaluated the model employing K-Folds cross validation for testing the model accuracy
- Showcased an overall prediction success rate of 91.3%
